# SSRI-EIB

These codes were created to pre-process and analyze data described in **'One-week escitalopram intake shifts excitation-inhibition balance in the healthy female brain: implications for individual cortical responsivity to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'** by Zsido & Molloy et al. 
<p>Here we used MATLAB based EEGLAB toolbox (version 14.1.1b) and custom written scripts. Our codes estimate resting-state EEG parameters associated with excitation-inhibition balance (i.e., alpha power and 1/f decay of the power-spectral density) in two groups at three time points. We used cluster statistics to investigate between and within group effects. </p>
