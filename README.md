# SSRI-EIB

These codes were created to pre-process and analyze data described in *'One-week escitalopram intake shifts excitation-inhibition balance in healthy female brain: implications for individual cortical responsivity to SSRIs'* by Zsido & Molloy et al. 
<p>It estimates resting-state EEG parameters associated with excitation-inhibition balance (i.e., alpha power and 1/f decay of the power-spectral density) in two groups at three time points. Cluster statistics is later done to investigate potential between and within group effects. </p>
